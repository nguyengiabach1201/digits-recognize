# Digits Recognize Using TensorFlow

## Training

I use TensorFlow available datasets and Kaggle to train

## Using

Draw an image with the size 28x28 pixels with number digits from 0 to 9 (black background and white for the digits)

Download the `model1` folder and run `main.py` with the following struct:
- Have the path to the model folder
- Have name of image files need to be recognized

And at the end, we have something like this
```
python main.py C:\Path\model1 img1.jpg img2.jpg
```

## Note
This is just a fun project (don't take this seriously)
